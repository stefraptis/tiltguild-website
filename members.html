                    Has too much fantasy for his own good. Writes down some lyrics when he feels like it. 
                    He enjoys reading, gaming, traveling while being in good company, or by himself. 
                    Big city life makes him feel old and he would very much preferred the Shire.

                <div class="bio">
                    Stefanos began his music journey in childhood, spending seven years in a conservatory studying piano and singing. 
                    He later taught himself guitar, bass, and percussion, playing in rock cover bands and solo. 
                    Now with Tilt Guild, he plays bass, composes, contributes lyrics, and channels his turmoil through extreme vocals. 
                    He is mainly influenced by bands like The Beatles, Tool, and Rage Against the Machine. 
                    Waking up from the dream, he claims to be a PhD candidate in Bioinformatics, though beers often take precedence.

                    Alternatively, he also listens to Angry Man or Tony Terror.
                    He chose the drums because it was the only thing he could hit hard without being prosecuted while imagining old schoolmates. 
                    His main musical influence is Nigel Glockler of Saxon.
                    Rumor has it that he spends his days reading recipes and petting cats. Others say that he is a physical therapist with academic and clinical activity.
                    He hates human interaction and his goal is to move to a village in Pelion. But with a 7-piece Pearl Export.
                    He claims that he will calm down when he manages to build a room full of drums and to play 300bpm double bass.
